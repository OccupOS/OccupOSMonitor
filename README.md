#OccupOSMonitor [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/OccupOS/OccupOSMonitor.png)](https://travis-ci.org/OccupOS/OccupOSMonitor)

Still haveily WIP and sorting some things out. But you can get started already and play with the app around if you want.

##Getting Started (for Dev's)

###Basic Setup

Install [Yeoman and its dependencies](http://yeoman.io/)

Install dependencies/build-tools via:

```
$ npm install
```

Fire up the server (it will automatically download js-dependencies via bower, compile the templates and build the whole ember-app):

```
$ grunt server
```

###Getting it to play nicely with OccupOSAPI

If you run everything locally, you need to download and setup the OccupOSAPI, which is using .NET as a basis. Everything should simply work as-is
