##Getting Started (for Dev's)

## Getting started

Install [Yeoman and its dependencies](http://yeoman.io/)

Install dependencies as well as packages (i.e. javascript libraries such as jQuery, etc.):

```
$ npm install && bower install
```

For now you also need to add ember-data.js manually, as well as the latest bootstrap.css (from the 3.0 Dev branch) into the components folder.

Fire up the server (it will compile the templates and build the whole ember-app as first task):

```
$ grunt server
```
